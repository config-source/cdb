The order of precedence is such that the nearest parent wins.</p> <p>Consider a simple Dev -&gt; Staging -&gt; Production example:</p> <p></p> <p>In this example the Production environment has three config values set on it: <code>owner=SRE</code>, <code>minReplicas=10</code>, <code>maxReplicas=100</code>. Since Production is the highest environment it inherits no values.</p> <p>The Staging environment promotes to Production and so is a child environment of Production. Since it does not have a direct value set for <code>owner</code> and <code>maxReplicas</code> it inherits those from Production. However it does have <code>minReplicas=1</code> set explicitly on it so that overrides the value from Production.</p> <p>The Dev environment promotes to Staging and has no direct Config Values set on it so it inherits all of it's configuration. You can see that it inherits <code>owner</code> and <code>maxReplicas</code> from Production as they aren't set on Staging but it inherits <code>minReplicas</code> from Staging as Staging values take precedence over Production as it is the nearer parent to Dev.</p> <p>Whether a Config Key can be inherited or not can be configured on the Config Keys themselves by an administrator. So for example if you don't want <code>maxReplicas</code> to ever be inherited you can configure that on the Config Key itself.</p>"}]}
